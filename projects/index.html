            <h3>Realistic CB Radio Retrofit</h3>
            <p>After a few years, regardless of maintenance or usage, the power source of a mobile phone which allows it to be mobile, its battery– usually a fragile foil sack of lithium salt in solution– is said to begin to lose its "life".</p>

            <p>Technology, or at least its consumer-oriented quantifiers– what we say are its features– has plateaued. Wireless signals and microprocessors are both fast and readily available around the world. This plateau of features stretches over multiples of what is considered healthy longevity for lithium batteries.</p>

            <p>Handset manufacturers may not explicitly plan the resulting obsolescence, but the final vectors of design and engineering rarely point toward a device being in existence– let along production– as little as 5 or 10 years on.</p>

            <p>Here, the idea of giving new life to an old object was to blur the line between new technology and the obsolescent.</p>

            <p>Pulling this project off required combining several circuit designs to compliment the various inputs and outputs, describing the corresponding features as a micro controller program and designing a custom PCB design to not only connect the pieces, but also to fit inside the original case without changing the existing aesthetic.</p>

            <p>The first step of the process was to take everything apart, to test various solutions on breadboards and to reverse-engineer the parameters of the controls, the microphone and speaker. Next was a back-and-forth of examining the mechanical design of the case and circuit board, measuring and drawing a design for a new board using KiCad, in order to have it fabricated using OSH Park (oshpark.com). Assembly was completed with only minor adjustments.</p>

            <p>And we should mention, all components including the small rechargeable battery are easily replaceable.</p>
