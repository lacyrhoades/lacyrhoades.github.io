            <h3>Realistic CB Radio Retrofit</h3>

            <p class="sub"><i>Ode for Tandy Corporation, Fort Worth, Texas 76102</i></p>
            
            <p>After a few years, regardless of maintenance or usage, the power source of a mobile phone which allows it to be mobile, its battery– usually a frail foil sack of lithium salt in solution– is said to begin to lose its "life".</p>

            <p>Meanwhile technology, or at least its consumer-oriented quantifiers– what we say are its features– has plateaued. Both wireless signals and microprocessors are reasonably fast and readily available around the world. This plateau of features stretches over a timescale in multiples of what is considered exceptional longevity for chemical batteries.</p>

            <p>Handset manufacturers may not explicitly plan the resulting obsolescence, but the final vectors of product design and industrial engineering rarely point toward a device being in existence– let alone production– as little as 5 or 10 years on.</p>

            <p>Here, the purpose for giving new life to an old object was to blur the line between new technology and the obsolescent.</p>

            </div>

            <p>Pulling this project off required 1) the combination of several circuit designs to compliment various input and output requirements, 2) describing the corresponding features as a micro controller program and 3) designing a custom printed circuit board to not only connect all the pieces, but also to fit inside the original case without changing the existing aesthetic.</p>

            <p>The first step of the process was disassembly, to reverse-engineer the parameters of the vintage elements and to create an electrical prototype on several breadboards. Next was a back-and-forth of measuring the mechanical nature of the device and translating the measurements into a physically compatible board using CAD software. PCB fabrication was done using OSH Park (oshpark.com) and assembly was completed with only minor adjustments.</p>

            </div>

            <p>And I should mention, most components including the small rechargeable battery are easily replaceable.</p>
