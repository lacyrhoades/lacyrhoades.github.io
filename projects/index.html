            <h3>Realistic CB Radio Retrofit</h3>
            <p>Browsing ShopGoodwill.com I found a pair of old radios, still in the original package, and was struck by the idea to design new circuits that made use of the existing chassis and controls. The idea was to create some kind of rechargable electronic noise making object that would look "cool" on a shelf as a conversation piece and would be a proof of concept in retrofitting old hardware with new technology. Pulling this off required a custom circuit and PCB design, which I first tested on breadboards and then drew up in KiCad, finally having it fabricated via OSH Park.</p>
